First, I downloaded the tarball from the assignment website, extracted the
files from my local machine, and then used Cyberduck to transfer to the
seasnet server.

I first typed 'make' - this output the following: gcc  -g3 -Wall -Wextra
-fanalyzer -march=native -mtune=native -mrdrnd randall.c -o randall
Then, I ran './randall' - this told me that the correct usage was
./randall NBYTES
So, I tried './randall 100' and this output:
_q?]?=>???X,#?-qO??)?[??6?H0?NU??/??Ï´/??N??o@?#l?x??????hn
To clean it up a bit, I ran './randall 100 | od -ta', which returned:
0000000   [   D enq   j   w   S   h   W   -   ; can  gs   2   Q   P   7
0000020   9   i   d   5 dc3   X   f   { nul   I  vt   ' enq   S   N   e

First goal: read and understand the code in randall.c
I opened it and got scared because it was 201 lines - first 30 or so
were comments and include statements, however.
The following are my notes as I tried to understand the code:
Lines 35-56: figures out what CPU you're running and determines if it can
support the RDRAND instruction
Line 58-78: uses CPU hardware to generate a random 64 bit number
Lines 82-111: uses software from /dev/random to generate random 64 bit num
Lines 113-126: function that writes the characters of the 64 bit num
- contains bit shift to print bytes
Lines 128-153: main figures out how many bytes to  print
Lines 155-171: figures out whether to use hardware or software to generate
random number
Lines 177-201: writes characters 1 at a time, fetching a new random number
as needed

Next: read and understand the code in Makefile
On line 31: default: randall
randall: looks for a source code input file named randall.c, and executes
command gcc <flags>
with input randall.c and output randall (executable) //$@ is randall
overall, it compiles
randall-assignment: helps tar it for you

Step 3: Make check
Check that randall outputs the correct number of bytes
We put the following line into a test test_script.sh:
   line a=$(./randall 5 | wc -c); if [ $a -eq 5 ]; then echo "success";
   else echo "fail"; fi
I then gave it execute permissions with chmod +x test_script.sh
In my Makefile, I added the following lines:
   check: randall test_script.sh
   ./test_script.sh
Then I ran: make check
     which returned "success"

Step 4: splitting source code into different modules
First part to break up: options.c that parses command line inputs and returns back to main portion of code

I moved a section of randall.c that i believed to be the 
command line parser part to options.c, and I moved the writebytes
function to output.c. I created options.h and output.h, but they are
currently empty. I also added options.c and output.c to the default randall make.
However, when I tried running 'make' I got Error 127.

I realized I didn't include any of the #include headers. Just for thoroughness,
for now, I copy pasted all of the headers from randall.c to options.c and
to output.c. This returned the following error:
gcc: fatal error: cannot execute '/usr/local/cs/gcc-10.2.0/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.2.0/cc1': 
vfork: Resource temporarily unavailable
compilation terminated.

To fix this, I tried adding #include "options.h" and #include "output.h" to 
the relevant files.
